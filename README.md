# Chip8 Emulator

## As the name suggests this is my attempt of creating my own emulator.

- Chip-8 is a perfect starting point for understanding how real systems execute instructions, manage memory, handle input, and draw graphics. 

- I hope to use this project as a stepping stone toward emulating more complex architectures, eventually building a RISC-V emulator.
